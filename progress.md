# Project Progress

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a refrigerator booking system for managing and reserving refrigeration equipment in the SQuIRL laboratory setting. The system includes a web application with a React frontend and a Node.js backend, allowing users to view and make reservations for various refrigeration equipment. The system also provides an admin panel for managing users and equipment.

## Current Status

### Frontend

The frontend of the project is well-developed using React and includes the following pages and components:

- **Dashboard**: Displays an overview of upcoming reservations and equipment status.
- **Calendar View**: Provides a calendar interface for viewing and managing reservations. Supports monthly, weekly, and daily views with mobile optimization.
- **Stats Dashboard**: Displays usage statistics and patterns for the refrigeration equipment.
- **Profile Page**: Shows user details.
- **Admin Panel**: Provides an interface for managing users and equipment without requiring admin privileges.
- **Layout Component**: Reusable layout with sidebar navigation for the application.
- **Sidebar Component**: Navigation component that provides links to different areas of the application.

### Backend

The backend of the project is implemented using Node.js and Express and includes the following components:

- **User Management**: Routes for managing user information.
- **Equipment Management**: Routes for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving equipment information.
- **Reservation Management**: Comprehensive routes for creating, updating, viewing, and deleting reservations.
- **Statistics**: Routes for retrieving usage statistics and equipment utilization patterns.
- **Database Models**: Mongoose models for Users, Equipment, and Reservations.
- **Middleware**: Validation middleware.
- **Utility Functions**: Database connection utilities.

### API Integration

- **API Service Layer**: Centralized API service for all frontend-backend communications.
- **Reservation Filtering**: Implemented filtering for reservations by user and equipment.
- **CORS Configuration**: Improved CORS settings for better security and cross-origin communication.
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for API requests and responses.

### Mobile Support

- **Responsive Design**: All components are fully responsive for various screen sizes.
- **Mobile-optimized Calendar**: The calendar view automatically adapts to mobile screens:
  - Switches to daily view on small screens
  - Adjusts layout for touch-friendly interface
  - Simplified controls for mobile users
- **Touch-friendly Forms**: Form inputs and controls are properly sized for touch interaction.
- **Mobile Navigation**: Implemented mobile-friendly navigation with slide-out sidebar.

### Recent Improvements

- **Removed Authentication Requirements**: Authentication has been removed to allow direct access to the system without login.
- **System Name Updated**: Changed system name to "SQuIRL Refrigerator Booking System".
- **Direct Calendar Access**: Made the calendar view immediately accessible as the landing page.
- **User Selection in Reservations**: Added user selection in reservation form to allow making reservations for any user.
- **Equipment Management**: Enhanced equipment management with color coding and simplified controls.
- **API-less Operation**: Implemented client-side data storage to eliminate API dependencies temporarily.
- **Admin Access for All**: Removed admin role restrictions to allow everyone to manage users and equipment.

### Deployment

- **MongoDB Connection**: Fixed MongoDB authentication issues by updating the connection logic and implementing a more robust connection handling.
- **Static File Paths**: Corrected the static file path issues by ensuring the server correctly serves files from the build output directory.
- **Port Binding**: Updated the server to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) to enable Render to access the server.
- **Environment Variables**: Added environment variables for Render deployment.
- **Render Deployment**: Successfully deployed to Render's free plan.

## Next Steps

### Potential Improvements

- **Offline Support**: Consider adding basic offline functionality for viewing existing reservations.
- **Data Export**: Add ability to export reservation data.
- **Email Notifications**: Implement email notifications for reservations.
- **Recurring Reservations**: Add support for recurring reservations.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Enhance the system's ability to detect and handle reservation conflicts.
- **User Preferences**: Allow users to save preferences for equipment and time slots.
- **Better Equipment Details**: Include more detailed information about equipment in the equipment list.
