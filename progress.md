# Project Progress

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a fridge booking system for managing and reserving fridge equipment in a school setting. The system includes a web application with a React frontend and a Node.js backend, allowing users to register, log in, and make reservations for various fridge equipment. The system also provides an admin panel for managing users and equipment, as well as a dashboard for viewing statistics and usage patterns.

## Current Status

### Frontend

The frontend of the project is well-developed using React and includes the following pages and components:

- **Login Page**: Allows users to log in to the system with authentication.
- **Registration Page**: Allows new users to register for an account.
- **Dashboard**: Displays an overview of upcoming reservations and user-specific reservations.
- **Calendar View**: Provides a calendar interface for viewing and managing reservations. Supports monthly and weekly views.
- **Stats Dashboard**: Displays usage statistics and patterns for the fridge equipment.
- **Profile Page**: Allows users to view and update their profile information.
- **Admin Panel**: Provides an interface for managing users and equipment.
- **Layout Component**: Reusable layout with sidebar navigation for the application.
- **Sidebar Component**: Navigation component that provides links to different areas of the application.
- **Auth Context**: Provides authentication state and functions throughout the application.

All frontend components are implemented and are using dummy data for display purposes. The application utilizes React Router for navigation and Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Backend

The backend of the project is implemented using Node.js and Express and includes the following components:

- **Authentication System**: Complete routes for user registration, login, and token verification.
- **User Management**: Routes for managing user information, updating profiles, and role-based access.
- **Equipment Management**: Routes for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving equipment information.
- **Reservation Management**: Comprehensive routes for creating, updating, viewing, and deleting reservations.
- **Statistics**: Routes for retrieving usage statistics and equipment utilization patterns.
- **Database Models**: Mongoose models for Users, Equipment, and Reservations.
- **Middleware**: Authentication, authorization (admin), and validation middleware.
- **Utility Functions**: Database connection and JWT token generation utilities.

### Docker and Deployment

- **Docker Configuration**: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerized deployment.
- **Render Configuration**: render.yaml for deploying the application on Render's free plan.

## Next Steps

### Pending Tasks

- **Connect Frontend and Backend**: Integrate the frontend with the backend API for real-time data fetching and updates.
- **Implement User Filtering**: Add ability to filter reservations by user and equipment as requested.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Further improve the responsive design for better mobile experience.
- **Add Calendar Filtering**: Implement the ability to filter calendar view by user and equipment.
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive testing for both frontend and backend components.
- **Documentation**: Add API documentation and user guides.

### Potential Improvements

- **Notification System**: Implement a notification system to alert users of upcoming reservations and changes.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Add more advanced filtering options for the calendar view to allow users to filter by date range, equipment type, and user.
- **Reporting**: Implement reporting features to generate detailed reports on equipment usage and reservation patterns.
- **User Roles**: Enhance the user roles and permissions system to provide more granular control over access to different features.
- **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for real-time updates on reservation changes.
