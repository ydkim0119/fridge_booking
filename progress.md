# Project Progress

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a fridge booking system for managing and reserving fridge equipment in a school setting. The system includes a web application with a React frontend and a Node.js backend, allowing users to register, log in, and make reservations for various fridge equipment. The system also provides an admin panel for managing users and equipment, as well as a dashboard for viewing statistics and usage patterns.

## Current Status

### Frontend

The frontend of the project is well-developed using React and includes the following pages and components:

- **Login Page**: Allows users to log in to the system with authentication.
- **Registration Page**: Allows new users to register for an account.
- **Dashboard**: Displays an overview of upcoming reservations and user-specific reservations.
- **Calendar View**: Provides a calendar interface for viewing and managing reservations. Supports monthly and weekly views.
- **Stats Dashboard**: Displays usage statistics and patterns for the fridge equipment.
- **Profile Page**: Allows users to view and update their profile information.
- **Admin Panel**: Provides an interface for managing users and equipment.
- **Layout Component**: Reusable layout with sidebar navigation for the application.
- **Sidebar Component**: Navigation component that provides links to different areas of the application.
- **Auth Context**: Provides authentication state and functions throughout the application.

### Backend

The backend of the project is implemented using Node.js and Express and includes the following components:

- **Authentication System**: Complete routes for user registration, login, and token verification.
- **User Management**: Routes for managing user information, updating profiles, and role-based access.
- **Equipment Management**: Routes for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving equipment information.
- **Reservation Management**: Comprehensive routes for creating, updating, viewing, and deleting reservations.
- **Statistics**: Routes for retrieving usage statistics and equipment utilization patterns.
- **Database Models**: Mongoose models for Users, Equipment, and Reservations.
- **Middleware**: Authentication, authorization (admin), and validation middleware.
- **Utility Functions**: Database connection and JWT token generation utilities.

### API Integration

- **API Service Layer**: Added a centralized API service for all frontend-backend communications.
- **Authentication Integration**: Connected AuthContext with backend API for proper authentication.
- **Reservation Filtering**: Implemented backend and frontend filtering for reservations by user and equipment.
- **CORS Configuration**: Improved CORS settings for better security and cross-origin communication.
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for API requests and responses.

### Docker and Deployment

- **Docker Configuration**: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerized deployment.
- **Render Configuration**: render.yaml for deploying the application on Render's free plan.

## Next Steps

### Pending Tasks

- **Fine-tune API Integration**: Ensure all API endpoints are properly connected and functioning.
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive testing for both frontend and backend components.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Further improve the responsive design for better mobile experience.
- **Documentation**: Add API documentation and user guides.

### Potential Improvements

- **Notification System**: Implement a notification system to alert users of upcoming reservations and changes.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Add more advanced filtering options for the calendar view to allow users to filter by date range, equipment type, and user.
- **Reporting**: Implement reporting features to generate detailed reports on equipment usage and reservation patterns.
- **User Roles**: Enhance the user roles and permissions system to provide more granular control over access to different features.
- **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for real-time updates on reservation changes.
